# R Programming Project

## Introduction

This project was carried out in collaboration by Claire Gefflot, Romain PÃ©nichon et Ariane Mostamandy. We utilized the dataset "Hostel.csv" available on the drive, sourced from the scraping of HostelWorld.com and also accessible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/koki25ando/hostel-world-dataset).

The primary objective of this project was to apply various concepts learned during our R training, including dplyr, data visualization, vectorized functions, and more. We aimed to develop simple and effective code while also delving into advanced concepts through self-directed learning.

## Part 1: Descriptive Analysis

In the first part of our project, we conducted a descriptive analysis of the dataset. We identified a relevant problem statement and summarized essential information extracted from the dataset. We paid particular attention to presenting the results using numbered tables and graphs.

## Part 2: Shiny Application

The second part of our project involved creating a Shiny application to complement our analysis. Our application provides users with an interactive experience, featuring a responsive map. This map allows users to make personalized selections. We deployed our application on Shinyapps.io for maximum accessibility.

### Utility and Significance of the Application

Our Shiny application enables users to visually explore the data interactively. It offers a deeper understanding of the information within the "Hostel.csv" dataset. Users can interact with the map to discover trends and insights.
